## About

These tutorials pair with the open-source book [_Mapping for a Sustainable World_](http://bit.ly/SDGbook). The book teaches principles of cartography through the United Nationsâ€™ 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Mapping for a Sustainable World was developed as a collaboration between the United Nations and the International Cartographic Association with the University of Wisconsin Cartography Lab supporting creation of the book layout and all maps and graphics through [National Science Foundation CAREER Grant #1555267](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1555267).

All tutorials demonstrate map design using the open access mapping software [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/). Thus, the objective of these tutorials is to enhance the cartographic design thinking described in Mapping for a Sustainable World with technical map software training, putting concepts into practice.

The tutorials were developed by Lily Houtman and Robert E. Roth of the [University Wisconsin Cartography Lab](https://geography.wisc.edu/cartography/) under NSF #1555267 and are freely available for personal or classroom/workshop use following a CC BY-NC license.

## How to Use These Tutorials

There are three sets of tutorials that follow the technical design and implementation of a choropleth, proportional symbol, and nominal map from _Mapping for a Sustainable World_. The tutorials are meant to be created sequentially and use a number 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc., to indicate the sequence.

The tutorials are meant to enhance but not replicate information from _Mapping for a Sustainable World_. Keywords from _Mapping for a Sustainable World_ use bold and italics and are followed with the definition from the glossary offset with a reference to the relevant book section (Note: _Mapping for a Sustainable World_ uses British English).
