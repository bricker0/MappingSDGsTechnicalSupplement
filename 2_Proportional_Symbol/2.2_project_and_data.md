## Tutorial 2.2: Projecting Map and Adding Data

**Summary**

**Tutorial 2.2** demonstrates how to add locational data to QGIS and to project the map (*Figure 2.2-1*).

**Using a European Projection**

Open QGIS. Click *New Empty Project*.

Import the UNMAP NAME. Refer to [**Tutorial 1.5**](/1_Choropleth/1.5_Project_and_Save.md) for more detail.

In the choropleth tutorial, you used the *Sphere_Eckert_IV* projection, a worldwide projection. However, this map is centered on Europe. Therefore, a worldwide projection is not the best choice.

Look at the projection options under *Project→Properties…* In the box next to *Filter* type *Europe* and look under *Predefined Coordinate Reference Systems* to see the options for Europe-specific projections.

*Apply* a few different options to see how they differ. When you are done, select *Europe_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic* for this project. While equal area projections are required for choropleth maps, they are not required for proportional symbol maps. This is because proportional symbol maps rely on a symbol on top of the geographic area, not the geographic area itself. However, using an equal area projection is still common.

Change the projection for the project and the file, like in [**Tutorial 1.5**](/1_Choropleth/1.5_Project_and_Save.md). Name the projected shapefile *reprojected_map_europe_albers.shp*.

**Joining CSV Files**

Import the two CSV files. 

Join *unid* and *cc* through their *GeoAreaCode* and *Country Code* fields. Export this joined file as a CSV called *unidcc.csv*.

Join *unidcc* with *reprojected_map_europe_albers* through the *ISO3CD* and *ISO3-digit Alpha* fields.

Refer to [**Tutorial 1.6**](/1_Choropleth/1.6_Add_Data.md) for more detail on joins.

Export this new file as *UN_inf_mor_albers.shp* and remove all other layers.

Now you have your location data projected properly. Save and proceed to [**Tutorial 2.3**: Extracting European Countries and Centroids](/2_Proportional_Symbol/2.3_select_europe_and_centroids.md).
