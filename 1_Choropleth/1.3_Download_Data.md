## Tutorial 1.3: Downloading Location and Attribute Data

**Summary**

**Tutorial 1.3** demonstrates how to download ***attribute*** and ***location data*** to make your choropleth map (*Figure 1.3-1)*. You will download four files:

1. Shapefile of countries in the world
2. Number of seats held by women in national parliaments
3. Number of seats in national parliaments
4. Comtrade Country Code and ISO list

Maps often compile data from many sources, often in incomplete or messy forms. It is your job to "clean up" the data so that it can be used harmoniously in a map.

> ***Location***: the where of geospatial data (see **Section 1.2**)

> ***Attribute***: the what or who of geospatial data (see **Section 1.3**)

**Downloading Location Data**

First, create a folder to store the project and data. In your preferred location on your computer, create a folder called *SDG_choropleth_tutorial*.

Note: The example uses a shapefile of countries in the world provided by the United Nations. This shapefile is not public yet, but is expected to be released soon. For now, use data from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/), which provides public domain map datasets.

Download [ne_110m_admin_0_countries](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/110m/cultural/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.zip) from Natural Earth, your location data. At its simplest, geospatial data are stored as a shapefile (extension .shp), a common format created by Esri recognized by most mapping software. Shapefiles actually are a combination of many files when viewed in a file folder. However, these are previewed and mapped as just a single file in mapping software like QGIS. Thus, it is recommended to rename, edit, join, etc., shapefiles in mapping software and not elsewhere to avoid corrupting the file.

Save the file in your project folder. Unzip the file to access its contents. If you do not have a program that can zip and unzip (sometimes called "compress" and "uncompress") zip files, download the open source *[7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)* program to do so.

**Downloading Attribute Data**

Download the data for SDG indicator 5.5.1 from the [Statistics Division of the UN website](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database). This database stores the data for all SDG indicators. 

Use the plus sign to expand *Goal 5→Target 5.5→Indicator 5.5.1*.

Click the boxes next to *Number of seats held by women in national parliaments* and *Number of seats in national parliaments*. [**Tutorial 1.7**](/1_Choropleth/1.7_Edit_Attribute_table_Map_Algebra.md) demonstrates how to normalize this data into a percentage. Downloading the number of total seats in parliament, not just the number of seats held by women, supports this ***normalization***.

> ***Normalization***: the conversion of absolute attributes to relative attributes to mask privacy of individual-level data and to ensure visual comparability of enumerated data across enumeration units of varying arrangement, shape, and size (see **Section 1.4**)

Click *Show table* (top of the page) to preview the data. ***Do not*** click the *Download* button at the top of the page. 

Scroll down and click *Download Excel* (bottom of the page) for each table. Click on the title of the table to see the *Download Excel* option. Save both files in your project folder.

**Downloading ISO3 Codes for Data Joins**

Finally, download the ISO3 code for each country, which provides each country with a unique identifier. 

Download the *Comtrade Country Code and ISO list.xlsx* file that is underneath *Attachments* on [this page from the UN Statistics Division](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/tradekb/Knowledgebase/Comtrade-Country-Code-and-Name).

In some browsers, the file does not automatically download when you click the name. If this happens to you, right click on the file and click *Save Link As...* to download.

Place this file in your project folder.

Now you have saved the necessary attribute and locational data to make your choropleth map. Proceed to [**Tutorial 1.4**: Cleaning Attribute Data](/1_Choropleth/1.4_Clean_Data.md).
